        "If some children are familiar with cows from the English rhyme ‘Old MacDonald had a farm’ with cows moo-ing, others would have seen them at their homes or on some farms. Children are fascinated by cows because of their gentle and harmless nature. We often see that cows would pass by us without causing any trouble and they never seem to be in a hurry even while we try to move them by honking our car horns. Cows are large animals with big bodies covered in skin that can be white, black, brown, or a mix of these colors. They have four legs that help them walk slowly and steadily. On their heads, they have two ears that can hear sounds from far away and two big eyes that can see everything around them. Cows also have a long tail that swishes back and forth to keep flies away. They have a big nose that helps them smell the grass and food they like to eat. Cows are herbivores, which means they only eat plants. Their favorite food is grass, but they also enjoy eating hay, grains, and vegetables. Cows spend most of their day grazing in fields, slowly chewing the grass with their strong teeth. They have a special stomach with four compartments that helps them digest the tough grass properly. A paragraph is a distinct section of a larger text that focuses on a single topic or idea.
